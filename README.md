# Civic Opportunity project

The Civic Opportunity Project will seek to provide a curated journey for Civic Tech volunteers. Our goal is to equip participants with the resources, exposure and toolsets to excel in a competitive workforce. The project will continuously iterate the experience process and ultimately exist as software that can be streamlined, scaled and replicated.
